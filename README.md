Online Reservation System
The Online Reservation System is a simple Java-based application that enables users to make, cancel, and view reservations. The system requires users to log in with a username and password before accessing the main system. Once logged in, users can make a reservation by providing their name, train number, class type, date of journey, and travel destinations. They can also cancel a reservation by providing the PNR number and view the details of a reservation by providing the PNR number.
The system uses a simple in-memory database to store reservation information, implemented using a HashMap to store Reservation objects. The system consists of several classes, including Database, Login, MainSystem, Reservation, ReservationSystem, and CancellationForm, each responsible for managing different aspects of the system.
While the system provides basic reservation functionality, it has some limitations. For instance, it does not persist data between runs, handle concurrent access, or validate user input. Future development plans include implementing a persistent database, adding concurrency control, improving user input validation, and adding more features such as searching for reservations and viewing reservation history.
